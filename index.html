        The ocean is home to many wonders, and one of the most fascinating is 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioluminescence" target="_blank">bioluminescence</a>. 
        This is the ability of living organisms to produce and emit light. The phenomenon can be seen in many marine creatures, 
        from tiny plankton to large fish. Unlike sunlight, this glow comes from a chemical reaction inside the organism's body.
        <br><br>

        The light is produced when a substance called 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferin" target="_blank">luciferin</a> 
        reacts with oxygen. This reaction is often helped by the enzyme 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luciferase" target="_blank">luciferase</a>, 
        which speeds up the process. The result is a glowing blue or green light that can last for seconds or even hours. 
        This chemical process is highly efficient, meaning it produces little to no heat.
        <br><br>

        Marine organisms use bioluminescence for many purposes. Some, like deep-sea squid, use it for 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-illumination" target="_blank">counterillumination</a>, 
        a form of camouflage where the glow helps them blend in with faint light from above. Others, like anglerfish, use a glowing lure 
        to attract prey in the darkness of the deep ocean. For plankton, glowing in large groups may confuse predators and help them escape.
        <br><br>

        Bioluminescence is also important in the study of 
        <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2019.00067/full" target="_blank">marine ecosystems</a>. 
        It plays a role in food webs, predator-prey relationships, and even in how scientists explore the ocean. Modern technology has allowed 
        researchers to record glowing events that can be seen from space, especially when 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plankton" target="_blank">plankton</a> 
        bloom in large numbers and light up entire coastlines.
        <br><br>

        Scientists are now studying bioluminescence for practical human applications. The genes responsible for light production 
        are being used in <a href="https://www.britannica.com/technology/biotechnology" target="_blank">biotechnology</a>, 
        such as medical imaging and disease detection. Learning how nature produces light so efficiently may also inspire new 
        forms of sustainable lighting in the future. The glowing ocean remains both a mystery and a guide for scientific innovation.
